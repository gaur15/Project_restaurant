README for Restaurant Chain Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance data of a restaurant chain, aiming to uncover insights regarding revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and churn indicators. The data includes transaction details such as meal type, order status, revenue, customer ratings, and more. The goal is to analyze temporal and behavioral trends to drive business decisions like promotions, product adjustments, and customer retention strategies.

Key Components

Data Loading & Preprocessing:
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate analysis.
Missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns were removed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations were created to explore key trends in meal type, order status, and revenue.
Temporal trends, such as busiest times and revenue spikes were identified.

Revenue Contribution:
Analysis of revenue contributions by meal type and order status was performed to understand which products and order statuses generate the most revenue.
Performance of Products:
Analysis was performed to identify underperforming meal types, such as Oatmeal


Libraries Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib: Visualization of key trends and insights

datetime: Handling date-time data

Insights:

Revenue Contribution: The analysis of revenue contribution by meal type and order status helped identify which meal types and statuses (completed vs. canceled) are the most profitable for the restaurant chain.
Busiest Times for Orders: Orders peak during weekends between 6 PM and 9 PM, indicating that targeted promotions during these hours could increase revenue. Weekday mornings show low activity, suggesting an opportunity to boost "Breakfast" revenue with special promotions or menu adjustments.
Temporal Trends: Revenue spikes during holidays and special events, with a notable increase of 30% compared to regular days. This presents an opportunity for the restaurant chain to plan for special event-based promotions or menu changes.

Questions That Can Be Asked:

What are the peak hours and days for orders, and how can we leverage this information for promotions?
How can we boost revenue during weekdays, particularly in the morning hours?
Which meal types contribute the most revenue, and which ones need marketing or recipe adjustments?
How do holidays and special events affect restaurant performance? Can we plan targeted promotions around these dates?
What factors influence customer retention, and how can we improve repeat order rates?
How effective are promotions and personalized recommendations in retaining high-frequency customers?
